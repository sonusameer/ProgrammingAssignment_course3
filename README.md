# ProgrammingAssignment_course3
README-file for the programming assignment of Course 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data
Description of the files included in this submission:

1 )run_analysis.R: This script takes as input the files described in Codebook.md and outputs a tidier dataset as specified in the course assignment instructions:
*You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2) Codebook.md: This file contains a brief description of the relevant aspects of the datastructure that comprised the dataset that run_analysis.R used as input.

3) new_tidy_data.txt: The file with the requested output, ie only standard deviation (std) and mean features.
